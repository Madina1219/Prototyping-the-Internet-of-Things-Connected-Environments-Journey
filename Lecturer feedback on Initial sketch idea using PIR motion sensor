## Feedback Summary

When I presented my first sketch, the lecturer appreciated the **creativity and ambition** behind combining **two lights** (the *plume light box* and the *Vespera*) into one responsive system.  

However, I was advised to **keep the interface simple** because this was my **first time building an IoT system**, and I was still learning the basics of **coding and MQTT communication**.

## Feedback from Duncan

Duncan encouraged me to:
- Focus on **understanding one sensor well** (the PIR motion sensor) instead of trying to control two light outputs.  
- Prioritise **data flow and MQTT connectivity** over building a complex interface.  
- Ensure I could **demonstrate a clear, working interaction** during the short presentation time, rather than risk having multiple connected parts that might fail.

## My Reflection

At that point, I realised I was **trying to do too much too soon**.  
I was excited about creating something visually impressive — making both lights react together — without yet understanding the **technical feasibility** or **timing challenges** involved.  

That moment made me step back and remember that I was still learning how all the pieces fit together — the sensor, Arduino, data, and network communication.

## How the Feedback Helped Me

This feedback helped me:
- Refocus on learning the **basics of sensor input and MQTT output**.  
- Simplify my design by choosing **one sensor (the PIR)** and **one output (the Vespera)**.  
- Understand that **simplicity and clarity** are more valuable at this stage than complexity.  

I learned that even a small, reliable demonstration is more powerful than an ambitious one that doesn’t work consistently.

## Action Taken After Feedback

- Removed the **plume light** from my main prototype concept.  
- Repurposed only the **plume box casing** as a physical enclosure for the Arduino, rather than wiring the light itself.  
- Focused entirely on getting the **motion-to-light connection** working smoothly via **MQTT**.  
- Later, after continued testing and facing calibration delays with the PIR, I decided to **switch to a microphone sensor** for a faster and more responsive demonstration.

## Lesson Learned

> “Good design is not about doing more — it’s about doing the essential things well.”

This moment of feedback completely reshaped how I think about **connected environments**.  
It taught me that the core goal is to **understand the data relationship between sensor, device, and network** before expanding into more complex systems.  

I now see simplicity as the foundation of strong design — every complex idea begins with a clear, working core.
